# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
### **Project Descripiton**
This game was created as a final project to close out and apply what I learned using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Requirements was to create a 2 player game that was fully functional, built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and was to be played using the DOM. There must be a way for a player to lose and a way for a player to win. Must consist of multiple rounds, and to keep on playing until a winner is decided.

I was able to get the game working, 2 players are able to win or draw. Players are able to restart the game and contiune playing if they were to chose so. I used HTML to setup my Divs, classes and ids to get the foundation for my game. HTML was also used to setup my grid for the tic tac toe game. I used CSS to style the game, adding color's to the font and background, hover effects, and used grid/flexbox to center everything within my container window. Javascript was used to create all the functions I needed to create a complete interactive tic tac toe game with the DOM. 

During the making of this game I ran into many challenges that stumped me along the way. I knew from the get go I wanted to used pictures to place into the tiles over "x's" and "o's". I was able to find free gifs to use but they were extremely small scaled in size. I was able to find a site that allowed me to resize my gifs to a bigger size that sutied that I needed. Another challenges I encountered was not being able to display the winner image for selected character chosen by the player on my winner pop up window. Due to this, it can be hard to know who one the game since it is not stated within the window.

Future goals, I would like to fix the winner display window to show the character selected that wins the game. I would also like to add a sound audio that will play when their is a winner or if their is a draw.
