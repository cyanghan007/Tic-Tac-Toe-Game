# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
### Project Descripiton
This game was created as a final project to close out and apply what I learned using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Requirements was to create a 2 player game that was fully functional, built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and was to be played using the DOM. There had to be a way for a player to lose and a way for a player to win. Must consist of multiple rounds, and to keep on playing until a winner is decided.
